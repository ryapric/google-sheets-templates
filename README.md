Google Sheets Tools
===================

What follows is a list of links to various tools built in Google Sheets. These
tools may have uses in personal finance, time & expense recording, or anything
at all that can be managed in a typical spreadsheet program. These shared Sheets
should be *read-only* to prevent a mess, and users can make a copy to their own
account in order to customize further.

Peronal Finance
---------------

* [Personal Finances](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RsUboySa_RHga-Ituf-jKzl4w3Yq9JhvpQQMRVPuw8E/edit?usp=sharing) - @ryapric
    - This Sheet has tabs for full paycheck estimation & outlay, expenses &
      budgeting, and a "lazy portfolio" worksheet (the default of which is
      [Taylor Larimore's three-fund
      portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios#Three_fund_lazy_portfolios)).
      Help and example use cases are available througout the Sheet as comments.
      The rule of thumb is: if the cell is highlighted, and it doesn't have a
      formula, then you are expected to edit that cell. Be sure to look
      carefully for the colored cell corners indicating comments, if you need
      help!
